# FEUP-ASSO

## Project:
Extension of the 2nd Case Study: INFO-SEC-COOK3R

### Objectives:
Requirements specified on the [PDF](./docs/InfoSecCooker.pdf).
Additional details:
- [ ] Grouping nodes into a new node (_i.e._ macros);
- [ ] Implement different types of sources, such as push sources (_e.g._ receiving http requests) or pull sources (_e.g._ reading from file);
- [ ] Serialization of recipes;
- [ ] Graphical interface for using pre-determined _sources_, _sinks_, and _handlers_;
- [ ] Recursivity: a node that calls itself, and which returns the value from the last recursive call;
  - May receive 2 inputs: one for the input value, and another for the stop condition (_e.g._ number of loops)
- [ ] Errors on type integrity violations (recursively check if arguments are of a valid type)
